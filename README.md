I had multiple problems to figure out when doing this assignment. First off, I accidentally pulled an old file onto the folder I made, and it caused 5000 files to show up in the changes tab. After trying to commit them, I guess nothing happened or the process went really slow, because I was unable to commit the regular files I had in my folder. I deleted and remade my repository at least two times, but Visual Studio Code wouldn't process the changes and the pending changes were all still in the tab. I shut down my computer and gave up to try the next day. The morning after, I checked Visual Studio Code and the changes tab was empty, but it still told me that I couldn't commit anything because another commit command was running in the background. At this point, I decided to give up on my computer and use my sister's computer to complete the assignment.

First, I had to download Visual Studio Code and Git onto her computer. I worked on the assignment and everything worked fine for the most part. When trying to push my changes onto Github, it gave me an error message saying that 

hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

So I found a Stack Overflow thread and forced the push, and that seemed to work okay.
